# ComportexViz

A web-based visualization layer for
[Comportex](http://github.com/nupic-community/comportex/).

See it in action in (this blog
post)[http://floybix.github.io/2014/07/11/visualization-driven-development-of-the-cortical-learning-algorithm/].


## Usage

Get [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) first.

Clone [Comportex](http://github.com/nupic-community/comportex/), and then install it:

```
lein do check, install
```

Clone ComportexViz from this repository, and then build it:

```
lein do cljsbuild clean, cljsbuild once
```

Now open `public/*.html` in a web browser, preferably Google
Chrome. Each HTML page loads the corresponding model defined
in `src/comportexviz/demos/`.
