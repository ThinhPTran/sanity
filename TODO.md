# TODO

* remove state from Layouts, just keep scroll-top & elements-per-dt in an atom

* config of drawing opts - keep steps / draw steps, size of bits, size of cols

* allow shifting back in time beyond draw-steps to extent of keep-steps

* plot most recent sliding window

* summary of % predicted etc in recent time

* controls to add noise to input generator

* trace back predicted columns to inputs (reverse encoders?)

* display duty cycles
* display numbers of dendrites
* snapshots (store state of `steps`)
* 2D input fields
* 2D column layouts

* allow different viz to be plugged in (runtime config)
